# Gowanus Directory

I personally used to work in a huge building in Gowanus along side the canal at 98 4th Street, Brooklyn, New York, 11231. There were dozens of difference companies and artists that worked in that building. I really wanted a way to bring them all together in a directory listing. This uses Jekyll to generate a blog, but I really wish it was simpler that that, I'd love one big YAML or JSON file of all the companies and a simple way of pulling that data into the webpage.

Now that I don't work in Gowanus anymore this project is pretty much dead. Has a pretty cool domain name though http://gowanus.co.
